 Our Approach Section:
Overall Layout: The section has a main heading "Our approach" centered at the top. Below this, there are large, visually distinct, white folder-shaped containers stacked vertically.

Distinct Folder-Shaped Containers with Overlap:

Each container is designed to clearly resemble a physical folder, with a distinct "tab" portion and a main body.

Crucially, these folders should visually overlap each other. When closed, each folder should slightly overlap the top edge of the folder directly below it, creating a sense of depth and a neatly stacked appearance, mimicking real-world folders.

The folders will feature a gradient-filled tab (smooth transition from teal to green) that further enhances their 3D, layered appearance. On the left side of each folder, there's a small tag, such as "TECHNOLOGY" for the overall section, and individual week indicators like "[01] WEEK" and "[02] WEEK" for each folder.

Accordion Functionality:

Initially, all folders should appear closed, with only their headings visible. For example, a closed folder would show "[01] WEEK" on the left and "Onboarding" as the heading on the right.

When a user clicks on a closed folder's heading, it should smoothly open downwards, expanding its body to reveal detailed content within. The opening animation should feel natural and fluid, as if a physical folder is unfolding.

Precise Element Alignment within Open Folder:

When a folder is open, all its internal elements (text, bullet points, image/video thumbnail, icons, and buttons) must be properly and meticulously aligned.

For the "Onboarding" example, the left internal file-like structure (with "New project" and list items) should be perfectly aligned with the content block on the right.

The main text block, "Result" heading, detailed result text, and the three distinct icons ("Selecting Specialists," "Communication Standards," "Project Management") with their labels, as well as the "BOOK A FREE STRATEGY CALL" button, should all maintain impeccable visual alignment and spacing, ensuring a clean and professional presentation.

Only one folder should be open at a time; opening a new folder should automatically close the currently open one with a smooth animation, ensuring the overlap effect adjusts correctly during transitions.

The "week" labels ([01] WEEK, [02] WEEK) should be visually integrated as shown.
