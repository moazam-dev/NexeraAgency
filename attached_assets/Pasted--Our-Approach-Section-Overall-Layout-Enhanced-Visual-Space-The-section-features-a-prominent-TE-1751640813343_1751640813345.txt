. Our Approach Section:
Overall Layout & Enhanced Visual Space: The section features a prominent "TECHNOLOGY" tag centered above a large, bold heading "Our approach". Below this, there is a vertically stacked series of clean, rounded rectangular containers. Crucially, ensure generous vertical spacing between the main heading and the first accordion bar, as well as ample, balanced spacing between the individual bars themselves, to prevent a "congested" appearance and allow elements to breathe.

Dynamic Abstract Background: To significantly enhance the visual depth and move beyond a "simple" look, the background of this section should incorporate subtle, abstract 3D elements or animated graphic patterns. These elements should:

Be rendered using React Three Fiber and could consist of slow-moving, translucent geometric forms, flowing light streaks, or very faint, interconnected particle networks.

They should subtly interact with the scroll, perhaps shifting perspective or intensity as the user navigates the section.

Adhere to the overall black/white/gradient accent theme, integrating seamlessly without distracting from the main content of the accordion bars. This adds a sophisticated, modern backdrop to the approach steps.

Modern Accordion Bars with Overlap:

Each step is presented as a sleek, white, rounded rectangular bar. These bars should visually overlap each other slightly, creating a subtle layered effect that adds depth and a modern, tactile feel, as if they are stacked elements. The rounded corners should be pronounced and smooth.

On the left edge of each bar, a subtle gradient-filled tab (transitioning from teal to green) is partially visible. This tab provides a distinct visual accent and indicates an active or selectable element. When a bar is active or expanded, this gradient tab should become more prominent.

Each bar displays the main heading for that step (e.g., "Onboarding," "Exploration," "Implementation") on the left side, using a bold and clear sans-serif font. A prominent plus icon (+) is positioned on the far right, aligned with the heading, signaling its expandable nature.

Dynamic Expansion & Precise Content Display:

Initially, all bars appear closed, showing only their main heading and the plus icon.

When a user clicks on a bar, it should smoothly expand downwards to reveal its detailed content. The expansion animation should be fluid and elegant, making the content appear seamlessly within the white bar's expanded area. The plus icon should animate (e.g., rotate to a minus sign) to indicate the open state.

Meticulous Internal Content Alignment: When a bar is open, all its internal elements must be properly and meticulously aligned and laid out for optimal readability and visual appeal.

For the "Onboarding" example, the expanded content should feature a multi-column layout. On the left, an internal file-like structure (e.g., "New project" with a list of items like "Presentation," "Briefing," "Accesses," "Roadmap," "Deadlines," "Reporting," "Documentation," and "Monitoring," potentially with a small content preview window).

On the right, a detailed text block explaining the step (e.g., "We conduct a briefing..."), followed by a clearly defined "Result" heading and a detailed description of outcomes.

Below this, a set of three distinct icons with associated labels (e.g., "Selecting Specialists," "Communication Standards," "Project Management") should be perfectly aligned horizontally with appropriate spacing.

A prominent "BOOK A FREE STRATEGY CALL" button should be present at the very bottom of the expanded content area, all contained within the sleek, white, rounded container.

Only one bar should be open at a time; expanding a new bar should automatically and smoothly collapse the previously open one, ensuring the overlap effect adjusts correctly during transitions.

Subtle Interactivity: Implement a subtle hover effect on the closed bars (e.g., a slight shadow, a very subtle scale-up, or a highlight on the plus icon/gradient tab) to indicate interactivity before clicking.
