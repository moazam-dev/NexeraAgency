. Services Section:
Concept: Interactive 3D Morphing Grid:

Instead of static cards, this section will feature a dynamic grid composed of abstract, minimalist 3D shapes. Each shape represents a service.

The initial state should be a clean, visually appealing arrangement of these abstract forms, fitting the black and white theme, with subtle gradient accents (teal to green) inherent in their material or lighting.

Interaction (Hover):

When a user hovers over an abstract 3D element, it should perform a sophisticated, smooth morphing or unfolding animation. This transformation will reveal the underlying service's identity. For example, a simple geometric form could subtly deform into a recognizable, stylized icon related to "Web Development," or a collection of flowing particles could coalesce into a symbol for "SEO."

Simultaneously, the service title (e.g., "Web Development", "SEO", "PPC") and a concise, modern-looking description should animate into view, perhaps sliding up or fading in with a distinct, clean typography.

Interaction (Click):

Clicking the transformed service element should trigger a more expansive, immersive 3D animation. This could involve the selected element smoothly expanding to occupy a larger portion of the screen, or the entire section seamlessly transitioning to a dedicated detail page for that service. The transition itself should be visually striking, possibly involving a "zoom into" the morphing element or a "portal-like" effect.

Animation & Technology:

Utilize React Three Fiber for rendering the base 3D grid and the intricate morphing/unfolding animations of individual service elements.

React Spring or Framer Motion should be employed for physics-based, fluid transitions of the 3D shapes, as well as the appearance and disappearance of text elements, ensuring a high level of polish and responsiveness.

Layout: The grid should be fully responsive, adapting the number of columns and the size of the 3D elements to provide an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The background of this section should maintain the dark aesthetic but can have subtle light elements or gradients to emphasize the 3D forms.
